# HuellHowserRoku

In honor of Huell Howser, I wrote a free Roku Channel to stream his episodes called "Huell Howser's California".

It was my first stab at Roku development, but I think it turned out quite well.  

It provides a nice interface on your TV to access the videos archived by Chapman University (http://blogs.chapman.edu/huell-howser-archives/).

You can search for episodes, or my favorite just click the random button to roll the dice and watch episodes in random order.

To add it to your Roku, login to your account at https://my.roku.com/account/add and type in "Huell" on the Add Channel screen 
or go to https://owner.roku.com/add/Huell
